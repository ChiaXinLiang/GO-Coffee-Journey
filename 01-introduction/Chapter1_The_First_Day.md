# Chapter 1: The First Day ðŸŒ…

## Marcus's Story Begins...

It's Monday morning, and Marcus arrives at the GoCoffee headquarters, excited but nervous. The office smells like freshly brewed coffee (of course!), and the CTO, Sarah, greets Marcus with a warm smile and a cup of their signature blend.

"Welcome to GoCoffee, Marcus! We're so glad you're here. Let me tell you why we chose Go for our new system..."

Sarah explains that their old system, written in various languages, has become a maintenance nightmare. Orders get lost during rush hours, the inventory system crashes randomly, and adding new features takes forever.

"We need something better," Sarah says. "Something that can handle thousands of orders per minute, won't crash when things get busy, and is easy for our team to maintain. That's why we chose Go."
